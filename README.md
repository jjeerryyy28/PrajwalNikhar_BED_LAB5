To create an Employee Management System using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf, I have implemented the following functionalities:

View all records from the database table
Insert new records into the table
Update an existing record in the table
Delete existing records from the table
The UI of the application includes the following screens:

Home Page: This screen displays a list of all employees currently in the database. Each row displays the employee ID, name, and department. There is also an "Add Employee" button that redirects to the Create Employee screen.

Create Employee: This screen provides a form to enter details for a new employee. The user can enter the employee's name and department and click the "Save" button to save the employee to the database. After the employee is saved, the user is redirected back to the Home Page.

Update Employee: This screen provides a form to update an existing employee. The user can edit the employee's name and department and click the "Update" button to update the employee's record in the database. After the employee is updated, the user is redirected back to the Home Page.

To run the application, simply run the main class of the project. Once the application is running, navigate to http://localhost:8080/ to view the Home Page. From there, you can add new employees, update existing employees, or delete employees from the database.

Note: Assume that the appropriate database and table have been created and configured in the application.properties file.
